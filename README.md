# US-Presidential-Elections-2020-Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment Analysis is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows us to determine
algorithmically whether a statement or document is “positive” or “negative”. It allows
individuals and organizations to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media
content. Keeping abreast of socio-political developments is especially important during periods
of policy shifts such as election years, when both electoral candidates and companies can benefit
from sentiment analysis by making appropriate changes to their campaigning and business
strategies respectively.

The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of tweets posted on US Presidential 
Elections 2020. The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight 
into the 2020 American Elections.
